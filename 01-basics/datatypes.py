# In python everything is object
# The Data types in python are:

# 1. Numbers : int, float, complex {123, 123.45, 123+45j,Decimal(), Fraction()}

# 2. String : str { 'hello', "hello", '''hello''', """hello"""}

# 3. List : list  [1,2,3,4,5] . list is mutable . list is contiguous memory allocation.list can contain any type of data.and list can also contain list.

# 4. Tuple : tuple  (1,2,3,4,5) . tuple is immutable. tuple is contiguous memory allocation. tuple can contain any type of data.and tuple can also contain tuple.

# 5. Dictionary : dict  { 'name':'john', 'age':25} . dict is mutable. dict is non-contiguous memory allocation. dict is key-value pair.

# 6. Set : set  {1,2,3,4,5} . set is mutable. set is non-contiguous memory allocation. set is unordered collection of unique elements.

# 7. Boolean : bool  True, False . bool is immutable. 

# File : file  open('file.txt') . file is mutable. file is non-contiguous memory allocation. file is used to read and write data.
